        <h3>7 ways to improve manufacturing
          </h3>

        <p class="para-text">
         <h4>From product design, through production, and into the 
            supply chain</h4> 
    
            Manufacturing companies across the world are increasing the adoption of Industry 4.0 digital 
            technologies at an incredible pace. They're taking advantage of enhanced visibility, performance, 
            and communication opportunities to resolve challenges that put strains on already tight margins. 
            These may be the result of costs associated with operations, regulatory compliance, and 
            innovation.
            To address the immediate needs for factory operations, 79% of manufacturers surveyed report 
            that they're already making technology changes at the corporate or plant/factory level to move 
            their businesses forward.
            If you're not considering digital transformation as a means to a healthy future for your 
            manufacturing business, you may fall behind the competition. Fortunately, many of the ways IoT 
            is transforming the industry makes it possible for manufacturers to address business challenges 
            by implementing digital technology from edge-to-edge into factory operations.
            Here are seven ways to take advantage of today's Industry 4.0 technologies and improve your 
            manufacturing operations:
          
        </p>

        <p class="para-text">
            <h4>Seeing into your operations</h4> 
            Automation is playing a key role in turning manufacturing facilities into digital enterprises. As 
            the proliferation of sensors expands throughout the digital factory, manufacturers are gaining 
            greater visibility into the production process, enabling decision-makers to see everything from a 
            single viewpoint.
            Improved visibility and near real-time access to complex, aggregate data helps to facilitate 
            responsive decision making, the discovery of opportunities for new revenue streams, relief for 
            workforce shortages, and an improved customer experience – all enabling growth.
            79% of manufacturers surveyed report that they're already making technology changes at the 
            corporate or plant/factory level to move their businesses forward.
            
            
             
           </p>


           <p class="para-text">
            <h4>Keep your equipment running</h4> 
            Malfunctioning equipment can have detrimental effects on production flow – interruptions in the 
            execution of production line changeovers, the costs associated with storing produced goods, and 
            costs of lost productivity per minute to name a few. These challenges can be greatly reduced by 
            investing in predictive, rather than preventative, maintenance.
            Predictive technology can utilize IoT data to help identify when a piece of machinery is 
            performing at sub-par levels, and then alert managers of unscheduled maintenance needs. Access 
            to this information can help them to plan accordingly – scheduling to take equipment down with 
            an alternative in place to mitigate downtime and interruptions in production.
            
            
             
           </p>


           <p class="para-text">
            <h4>Better performance minute-by-minute</h4> 
            Productivity is the heartbeat of manufacturing operations. It's no surprise that 58% of larger 
            manufacturing companies are counting on IoT to improve workflow. For example, machine 
            learning can provide analysis of equipment and processes to make automated adjustments during 
            production, manage energy consumption, and reduce waste.
            This smart manufacturing environment also helps businesses to streamline both automated and 
            human activities throughout the factory. This can help to protect and improve the overall quality 
            of products produced while also increasing operational efficiency through production 
            optimization.
            
            
             
           </p>
        <p class="para-text">
    <h4>Preventing hacking of the factory and 
        operations</h4>
        The reveals that 80% of companies experienced a cyberattack or breach over the previous 12 
months. The ever-increasing number of connected devices provides better visibility into 
manufacturing operations; however, it also creates additional opportunities for cybercriminals to 
access sensitive data such as trade secrets and customer information in the manufacturing 
network.
To protect business integrity against the evolving threat landscape, it's important to consider all 
points of entry into your organization's network with endpoint management, including securing 
assets, internal, remote, and third-party vendor relationships.
        </p>

        <p class="para-text">
          <h4>Monitoring pallets, containers, and other 
            assets</h4>  
            Manufacturing relies on assets both within the factory and out in the field to be available and 
            operational, but managing the location and condition of these assets can be complex. Managers must be able to have insight into the condition, activity, and location of these, but do so in a 
            format that simplifies the complexity.
            Unified asset management empowers operations managers to realize this possibility to better 
            track and plan for the assignment and maintenance of assets. This can help prevent unexpected 
            interruptions that contribute to sluggish productivity, poor use of capital investments, and loss of 
            revenue.
          </p>

          <p class="para-text">
          <h4>Flexible networks for growth and 
            opportunities</h4>  Consumer demand is an ever-changing environment.
            As the market shifts from brick-and-mortar stores to more e-commerce and direct-to-consumer 
            models which influence activities in the supply chain, manufacturers are having to adopt greater 
            agility to maintain production levels and remain relevant in their industries. Of smaller 
            manufacturing companies, 55% acknowledge this need for scalability and plan on using IoT to 
            help become more responsive to changing market conditions.
            Two such adjustments are the adoption of a software-defined network and edge technologies. 
            Virtualizing functions across different production sites through a single network appliance helps 
            decrease deployment speed, improves flexibility, and can help reduce speed to market time.
            To further enhance agility, accessing data on the edge of the network can deliver a faster 
            response time to address operational changes during peak production periods.
            
            
          </p>

          <p class="para-text">
          <h4>Sharing critical knowledge and information
        </h4>  Outdated communication practices can cause gaps in efficiency and interruptions to output 
        through poor and miscommunication.
        Providing better communication and collaboration opportunities between employees enables 
        leaders to make sure that critical alerts are delivered as needed. It also helps knowledge from 
        seasoned workers to be easily shared with new hires. An added benefit is that data-centric 
        technologies and enhanced communication help them to be more productive, including while 
        working in collaboration with robotics, augmented reality (AR), and other digital innovations.
        An edge-to-edge strategy can help manufacturers to create a more stable environment for 
        production, communication, and collaboration from the factory floor to the field. Employing 
        Industry 4.0 technology that includes a flexible, reliable, highly secur
