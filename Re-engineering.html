        <h3>Business Process Reengineering Step
          </h3>
        <p class="para-text">
            Unlike business process management or improvement, both of which focus on working with 
            existing processes, BPR means changing the said processes fundamentally.
            This can be extremely time-consuming, expensive, and risky. Unless you manage to carry out 
            each of the steps successfully, your attempts at change might fail.
              </p>
        <p class="para-text">
          <h3>Step #1: Identity and Communicating the Need for Change</h3>
          If you're a small startup, this can be a piece of cake. You realize that your product has a high 
user drop-off rate, send off a text to your co-founder, and suggest a direction to pivot.
For a corporation, however, it can be a lot harder. There will always be individuals who are 
happy with things as they are, both from the side of management and employees. The first might 
be afraid that it might be a sunk investment, the latter for their job security.
So, you'll need to convince them why making the change is essential for the company. If the 
company is not doing well, this shouldn't be too hard.
In some cases, however, the issue is with the company not doing as well as it could be. Meaning, 
you should do your research. Which processes might not be working? Is your competition doing 
better than you in some regards? Worse?
Once you have all the information, you'll need to come up with a very comprehensive plan, 
involving leaders from different departments. The management will have to play the role of 
salespeople: conveying the grand vision of change, showing how it'll affect even the lowestranked employee positively

        </p>

        <p class="para-text">
          <h5>Risk of Failure: Not Getting Buy-In From The Company</h3>
            If you fail to do this, however, your business process reengineering efforts might be destined to 
            fail long before they even start.
            Business Process Re-Engineering can seriously impact everyone in the company, and sometimes 
            this can appear to be a negative change for some. Some employees might, for example, think 
            you'll let them all go if you find a better way to function (which is a real possibility).
            In such cases, even if the management is on board, the initiative might fail because the 
            employees aren't engaged.
            Usually, it's possible to get the employee's buy-in by motivating them or showing them different 
            views they weren't aware of. Sometimes, however, the lack of employee engagement might be 
            because of bad workplace culture – something that might need to be dealt with before starting 
            any BPR initiatives.
            Getting your employee to commit to change isn't easy
        </p>

        <p class="para-text">
          <h3>Step #2: Put Together a Team of Experts</h3>
          As with any other project, business process reengineering needs a team of highly-skilled, 
motivated people who will carry out the needed steps.
In most cases, the team consists of:
<h5>• Senior Manager.</h5>
 When it comes to making a major change, you need the supervision of 
someone who can call the shots. If a BPR team doesn't have someone from the senior 
management, they'll have to get in touch with them for every minor change.
<h5>• Operational Manager.</h5>
 As a given, you'll need someone who knows the ins-and-outs of 
the process – and that's where the operational manager comes in. They've worked with 
the process(es) and can contribute with their vast knowledge.
<h5>• Reengineering Experts.</h5>
 Finally, you'll need the right engineers. Reengineering 
processes might need expertise from several different fields, anything from IT to 
manufacturing. While it usually varies case by case, the right change might be anything –
hardware, software, workflows, etc.
<h5>Risk of Failure: Not Putting The Right Team </h5>
There are a lot of different ways to mess this one up.
If the team consists of individuals with a similar viewpoint and agenda, for example, they might 
not be able to properly diagnose the problems/solutions.
Or, the team might involve too many or too few people. In the first case, the decision-making 
might be slowed down due to conflicting viewpoints. In the latter, there might not be enough 
experts in certain fields to create adequate solutions.
It's hard to put all that down as a framework, as it depends on the project itself. There is one 
thing, however, that benefits every BPR team: having a team full of people who are enthusiastic 
(and yet unbiased), positive and passionate about making a difference.</p>

        </p>

        <p class="para-text">
            <h3>Step #3: Find the Inefficient Processes and Define Key Performance 
                Indicators (KPI)</h3>Once you have the team ready and about to kick-off the initiative, you'll need to define the right 
                KPIs. You don't want to adapt to a new process and THEN realize that you didn't keep some 
                expenses in mind – the idea of BPR is to optimize, not the other way around.
                While KPIs usually vary depending on what process you're optimizing, the following can be very 
                typical:

                <h5>• Manufacturing</h5>
                <h6>o Cycle Time</h6> – The time spent from the beginning to the end of a process
                <h6>o Changeover Time</h6> – Time needed to switch the line from making one product to 
the next
<h6>o Defect Rate</h6> – Percentage of products manufactured defective
<h6>o Inventory Turnover</h6> – How long it takes for the manufacturing line to turn 
inventory into products
<h6>o Planned VS Emergency Maintenance</h6> – The ratio of the times planned 
maintenance and emergency maintenance happen
<h5>• IT</h5>
<h6>o Mean Time to Repair</h6> – Average time needed to repair the system/software/app 
after an emergency
<h6>o Planned VS Emergency Maintenance</h6> – Number of support tickets closed by the support 
team divided by the number opened
<h6>o Application Dev</h6>. – The time needed to fully develop a new application from 
scratch
<h6>o Cycle Time</h6> – The time needed to get the network back up after a security breach
Once you have the exact KPIs defined, you'll need to go after the individual processes. The 
easiest way to do this is to do business process mapping. While it can be hard to analyze 
processes as a concept, it's a lot easier if you have everything written down step by step.
This is where the operational manager comes in handy – they make it marginally easier to define 
and analyze the processes.
Usually, there are 2 ways to map out processes:
<h6>• Process Flowcharts</h6> – the most basic way to work with processes is through flowcharts. 
Grab a pen and paper and write down the processes step by step.
<h6>• Business Process Management Software</h6> – if you're more tech-savvy, using software 
for process analysis can make everything a lot easier. You can use Tallyfy, for example, 
to digitize your processes, set deadlines, etc. Simply using such software might end up 
optimizing the said processes as it allows for easier collaboration between the employees.

          <p class="para-text">
            <h3>Step #4: Reengineer the Processes and Compare KPIs</h3>
            Finally, once you're done with all the analysis and planning, you can start implementing the 
solutions and changes on a small scale.
Once you get to this point, there's not much to add – what you have to do now is keep putting 
your theories into practice and seeing how the KPIs hold up.
If the KPIs show that the new solution works better, you can start slowly scaling the solution, 
putting it into action within more and more company processes.
If not, you go back to the drawing board and start chalking up new potential solutions
