        <h3>7 Steps to Successful Technology
          </h3>
        <p class="para-text">
            <h3></h3>
            
New technology can make your organization more 
effective and productive, but only if the people within your organization use the new 
technology.
I’m sure you have a plan for how you’re going to implement the technology, but do you have 
a plan for how you’re going to increase user adoption?
If users don’t adapt to and adopt the new technology, it is wasted money, effort, and time. 
Your ROI tanks. User adoption is not just achieved by training users on how to use the new 
technol

          </p>
        
        
          
          <p class="para-text">
            <h3>Align technology and strategy</h3>
            When choosing which technology to implement for your business, 
don’t just weigh the name of the vendor and the price. Take a look at your strategy. Think 
about how new technology will help you achieve your strategic goals.
The purpose of introducing new technology to a business is to improve performance. Start 
with the goals you want to achieve, and then plan backward, finding a technology that best 
supports improved performance. People are more likely to adopt new technology if they can 
see how it helps them to achieve their goals and objectives
          </p>
        
          <p class="para-text">
            <h3>Communicate for buy-in and engagement</h3>
            Achieving user adoption for new technology requires communicating with stakeholders early 
and often. Before you can communicate with stakeholders you need to have all your 
stakeholder groups identified. The way each currently performs their work, processes, should 
be documented. The impacts the new technology will have on them need to be identified and 
communicated. Ways in which your organization will mitigate any negative impacts for 
stakeholders also need to be communicated.
You shouldn’t just be communicating cutover and go-live dates. Engagement requires 
communicating “with” and not “at” your stakeholders. Communicating for engagement 
requires audience segmentation. Not all stakeholders will need to hear the same message at 
the same time in the same way.
Informing stakeholders you are deploying new technology because “we need it” or because 
“leadership says so” or even because “it will help us compete” are not specific enough details 
to drive engagement – and engagement increases adoption.

          </p>
          
          <p class="para-text">
            <h3>Perform a current systems analysis</h3>
            Technology upgrades or introducing new technologies carries a huge compatibility risk –
what if the new systems turn out not to be compatible with those you already have or integration requires more build time than was anticipated. To prevent system integration 
issues, make sure you review all your current technology systems thoroughly before you 
consider deploying something new. Don’t just conduct detailed requirements gathering for 
the new technology, make sure the functionality of your current systems can support and 
integrate effectively with your new technology. Performing this work upfront will prevent 
system redundancies, reduce costly build times, and help the budget from ballooning.

          </p>

          <p class="para-text">
            <h3>Develop training approach early</h3>
            One of the biggest risks to user adoption is the lack of sufficient and customized training. 
Many vendors offer training options as part of your technology purchase, however, most of 
this training is standardized off the shelf and not specific to your business processes or 
culture. Training should not just be screenshots and PowerPoint. People need to see and play
in the system, prior to go-live, in the context of their specific work processes.
To increase adoption, make sure that training is specific to each stakeholder group and the 
way they perform their work. One quick way to increase resistance and decrease ad option is 
to make stakeholders feel they’ve wasted their time with training, and have them end up even 
more confused because they don’t see the connection to their work.
Additionally, not everyone will learn and adapt to new technology in the same way. Consider 
offering multiple training methods – electronic, classroom, smaller hands-on training labs –
various options ensure users feel most prepared.

          </p>


          <p class="para-text">
            <h3>Integrate technology deployment with change 
                management</h3>
                Many organizations are so focused on deployment and conversion, schedules and criteria, 
                that they fail to deploy and integrate a change management process for helping stakeholders 
                adapt and adopt the technology. This is often one of the biggest reasons for rocky 
                deployments, low adoption, and project failure. Technology only achieves desired goals if the 
                people adopt it, if they don’t, technology is just wasted money.
                To maximize adoption and minimize resistance, your deployment plan and the team must be 
                integrated with the change and managing plans and team. If you don’t have a change 
                management plan and resources in place then you may want to get on that pronto.
                Technology teams focus on building the technology, resolving technical issues, designing the 
                architecture, and deployment of the new technology. Change management teams focus on the 
                people. The change management team directly interacts with impacted stakeholders. They 
                identify areas of concern related to workflow and process. They often identify specific 
                training needs. They handle communication. They frequently advocate on behalf of 
                stakeholder groups, raising concerns and issues to leadership, mitigating risks, and alleviating 
                anxieties that can lead to resistance and decreased adoption.
                To maximize adoption you must place an equal focus on both the technology and the people.
                
          </p>

          <p class="para-text">
            <h3>Create an effective governance structure</h3>
            Create an effective governance structureMany technology deployments fail to establish an effective governance structure to lead and 
manage the deployment. Often project management and technology resources are assigned to 
govern the implementation, but the voice of impacted stakeholders and even customers are 
not represented. Effective governance can’t exist in a silo or a vacuum.
The governance structure should consist of executive sponsors and a mix of all stakeholders 
impacted by the technology changes. Think of this structure as a mini organization designed 
with the mission to execute the technology, change management, communication, training, 
manage risks and issues, and make project decisions. It is imperative for the individuals 
serving in a governance role to have the ability to voice concerns on behalf of their 
stakeholder groups. When people feel they have a voice that represents them and addresses 
their concerns, they are less likely to resist the technology and adoption is likely to increase
          </p>

        </p>

        <p class="para-text">
          <h3>Monitor and course correct</h3>
          Introducing new technology is likely to cause a major disruption to workflow. Monitor your 
deployment and consider whether the implementation schedule may need to be revised into 
smaller more manageable stages. Provide stakeholders opportunities to offer feedback. New 
technology impacts everyone, so listening to stakeholder opinions and concerns and adjusting 
your deployment as needed, is important for achieving adoption.
Not only does offering opportunities for feedback make everyone feel part of the change, but 
it also gives you important insights into what is working well and what may need to be 
adapted. Additionally, everything needs to be measurable and observable.
Once implementation has begun, do not assume that things will run on their own. Develop 
measurable success factors and performance metrics. Assess and evaluate regularly, keeping 
the goals you set at the start in the forefront
        </p>

    </p>

    <p class="para-text">
      <h5>Make it people first</h5>
      When implementing new technology, if you want to be successful you need to plan for, 
identify and address implementation challenges early, and gain the buy-in and commitment 
for technology – driving engagement, enhancing efficiencies, and improving user adoption –
enabling you to maximize your return on investment. Otherwise, your technology is just an 
expensive tool that no one uses effectively.
